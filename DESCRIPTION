Title: convert ArchR projects into SingleCellExperiments, and add some niceties
Description: ArchR is a glorious package for single-cell chromatin analysis, but
             its interactive tools for exploratory analyses leave something to 
             be desired. iSEE, by contrast, is fantastic for exploration and 
             spitballing. When combined with igvR (igv.js running on a socket),
             plotting genomic abundance, factor loadings, chromatin states, etc.
             becomes quite intuitive. archRiSEE bolts together the components 
             along with some NMF-related niceties for rapid iteration of 
             collaborative explorations, as when spitballing figures or for QC.
